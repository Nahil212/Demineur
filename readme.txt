This program is a simple minesweeper game created by Nahil EL BEZZARI and Adil SEIGOUDAVOUDOUMARECAR, the goal is to mark all the bombs that are hidden in a board. 
For that, you can discover any case but if you discover a case that is hiding a bomb: it's a "Game Over".
If you achieve to find all the bombs, you win and the program will show your score (your time) as well as the highest score. This is why the program requires the files "easyScore.txt" and "hardScore.txt" to work.
When you will launch the game, the program will ask you to choose between two difficulties:
- beginner (a board of 9*9 with 10 bombs)
- intermediate (a board of 16*16 with 40 bombs)

Have fun playing minesweeper ;)
